# Many of these packages pull in other linters and static analysis tools
# as well, so check venv/bin after you build and see what's there. These
# are mostly small modules and only add 30 seconds or so to your virtual
#environment build time. But you're free to remove them of course.
#
# If you don't have a disciplined or consistent coding style and would like
# one, but are too lazy to learn PEP8 or Google style, you should absolutely
# use yapf. It is very simple, and akin to clang-format- it will *not* break
# code, it will simply format your whitespace and such. You can have it use
# different pre-built profiles, such as Google's recommended style, or (by default)
# use PEP8
#
# If you have half a brain, you should be using pylint before every commit. It
# will catch typos, bad practices (including ones that will sting later, or only
# every once in a while (i.e. errors in Exception handlers that rarely, but sometimes
# fire. USE IT !! `pylint mypackage/` or `pylint myfile.py` will spit out a nice
# report. If certain things annoy you, you can configure it in .pylint or in setup.cfg
#
# You could also delete all of these if you'd like, they add about 20-30 seconds to
# venv build. But aside from that there is no cost.
#
# Note that you *must* leave twine and setuptools if you want to publish to a local
# or public PyPi repository, as setuptools packages your package and twine is the
# *new* but *correct* way to publish the package after setuptools builds it.
